# Voracious-Riches-Colors
A mod for the Voracious Riches game that plans to change the paper sprites and others to more of a colorful and complete version of their former sprites. Will also add QOL improvements. (Note: I'm not affiliated with SomeoneInflative's work, I just like the game). Go get to OG game here: https://someoneinflative.itch.io/voracious-riches
